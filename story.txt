There once was a badger named bucky who lived in a magical place called Camp Randall.
 
After a while, he was unsatisfied with life and began an institution near the stadium. It was a haven for learning and it was the cornerstone of society in the future. In this haven, there were multiple discplines such as reading, writing, maths and wizardry. As time went on, the disciplines evolved and produced even more faculties for learning. Unfortunately, wizardry ceased to evolve and was labeled a dark art. It is now a thing of legend.
